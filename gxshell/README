 -- gxshell --
tool to open a bash shell within the GlueX CentOS7.9 container (heavily inspired by and pinched from eic-shell, https://github.com/eic/eic-shell)

The tool will open a bash shell and set up the latest GlueX software within the GlueX container. This requires singularity and cvmfs (recommended) to be correctly installed and configured.
For more information see https://halldweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/HOWTO_use_the_GlueX_Singularity_Container.


Usage:
	Set up an alias like
		alias gxshell='singularity exec --bind /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/gluex/group/halld:/group/halld /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/jeffersonlab/gluex_prod:v1 gxshell'

	If you do not use cvmfs, point to the correct container on your system. Adjust binds as required.
	Then simply call
		gxshell
	and enjoy the magic world of a container that has all your software correctly set up.


Setup (only container maintainers):
	Copy the following files into the respective directories.
		cp gxshell /usr/local/bin/gxshell
		cp gluex-env.sh /etc/gluex-env.sh
		cp 10-docker2singularity.sh /.singularity.d/env/10-docker2singularity.sh
		cp 99-zz_cntrenv.sh /.singularity.d/env/99-zz_cntrenv.sh
